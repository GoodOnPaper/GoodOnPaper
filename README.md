+ Who         : I would like to be a fully capable programmer one day, but right now i am taking my time.
+ languages   : late 2022 I did a bit of Haskell and C. Currently im trying to learn Zig, and every once in a while i use python.
+ goal        : getting a job, by that i mean i am looking for one, (altough i am aware that there is not a lot i can give with my skills, im always trying to improve).
